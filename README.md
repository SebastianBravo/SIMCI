Alzheimer is a degenerative and irreversible neurological disorder that affects cognitive abilities and daily activities. It is divided into three stages: preclinical, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia. MCI represents a transition to dementia, characterized by a greater-than-expected decline in cognitive function without interference in daily activities. It is estimated that approximately 20% of individuals with MCI progress to dementia, but diagnostic errors are common in this early stage due to ambiguous cognitive changes, including those observed in neuroimaging.

SIMCI is a system for detecting mild cognitive impairment that employs a multimodal approach and a stratification process to address this issue. The system utilizes demographic characteristics and clinical test results to provide medical interpretability and assist specialists in decision-making. The database includes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans, clinical examination results, and demographic information. SIMCI achieves an F1-score of 0.9233, a sensitivity of 0.9200, and a specificity of 0.9275.
